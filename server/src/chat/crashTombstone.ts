/**
 * Mid-turn crash tombstones.
 *
 * When a CLI child dies while a turn is in flight it never emits a `result`
 * event, so nothing assistant-shaped ever reaches the event log. The working
 * window (see threadWindow.ts `extractVisibleTurns`) is derived from that log,
 * which means the next turn sees the user's request with NOTHING after it. The
 * model then truthfully reports "I didn't do anything" while the finished work
 * is sitting on disk.
 *
 * That happened for real on 2026-08-31: a WebKit iPhone test ran 8 minutes,
 * wrote screenshots and a report, then took an OOM SIGKILL (exit 137). The next
 * turn had no idea any of it existed and said so.
 *
 * The fix is to write a durable, assistant-shaped marker on abnormal exit. It
 * renders in the thread like any other reply (so the human sees the failure
 * instead of silence) and it lands in the model window (so the next turn knows
 * to go recover the work rather than re-run it).
